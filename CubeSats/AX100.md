# AX100

**ESD Sensitive! Always use an ESD mat, wrist strap and gloves!**

## Quickstart

- Connect a dummy load or antenna. Small loads are not designed to be left
  operating for more than 2-3 minutes at a time. So just remember to let it cool
  off.
- The easiest way to access the AX100 is by its 4-pin debug connector.
  - **DO NOT power the FTDI power and external poewr supply simultaneously**
  - **The external power supply ground and PC/Laptop ground must be the same**
- Removing the EMI shield will void the warranty on the product.

## Console Interface

- Manual recommends `minicom`.
- Use `sudo minicom -s` and go to console settings. Setup baudrate to 500.000
  baud, 8n1, and disable flow-control. Save as default.
- Then run: `minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -con`.

## Ports

| Port | Name              | Description                          |
| :--: | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
|  0   | CSP_CMP           | Control Port                         |
|  1   | CSP_PING          | Returns copy of the packet received  |
|  2   | CSP_PS            | Returns process list                 |
|  3   | CSP_MEMFREE       | Returns memory free                  |
|  4   | CSP_REBOOT        | Reboots subsystem                    |
|  5   | CSP_BUF_FREE      | Returns number of free buffers       |
|  6   | CSP_UPTIME        | Returns subsystem uptime             |
|  7   | AX100_PORT_RPARAM | Controls AX100 with parameter system |
|  8   | CSP_UPTIME        | Resets the AX100 ground WDT          |

- RPARAM port is used to service remote parameter get/set requests.
- The Ground WDT is a counter that'll count down to zero. If it reaches 0, it
  will delete the stored configuration from table zero and revert the AX100 back
  to running from the alternate boot file.

## Parameters

- A: Active Parameters. Checked by the firmware during execution. Changing them
  takes effect on the next execution of the codepath that uses it.
- B: Boot-up Parameters. This parameters can only be applied on system power-on.
  You must reboot the system for them to take effect.
- R: Read-only parameters. They can be written to, but the firmware will
  overwrite it at some later time. Only counters are an exception to this rule.
- P: Persistent Parameters. Will be stored each time they are changed in a
  separate memory location, allocated specifically for that single parameter.
  They are not overwritten when saving and loading parameters to/from a
  parameter table.
